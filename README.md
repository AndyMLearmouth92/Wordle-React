# React Wordle

React Wordle is an imitation of the popular word game: Wordle. You must try to work out the current solution by submitting guesses of 5 letter words. The letters will highlight green if they are fully correct and yellow if partially correct.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Optimisations

For optimisations, I want to focus on making the game mobile-friendly and allowing users to type directly into the boxes.

I also want to add a dark mode colour scheme and a toggle button.
